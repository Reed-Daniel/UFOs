# UFOs
## Project Overview
In this project we assisted Dana with building and formatting a dynamic webpage to provide users with the ability filter and analyze UFO sighting data collected from around the Country.

## Results
#### Full Table
Taking a glance at our dynamic table, we can see a long list of unique UFO sightings varrying on a number of different factors inlcuding date, location, shape of UFO, and duration of sighting.

#### Filtered Table
Users can enter specific criteria (ex. city: el cajon) into our collection of filters to narrow down the data set for whatever needs they have. Once the user has completed their analysis, they can simply clear their search criteria and press [Enter] to reload the full data set.

## Summary
### Drawbacks:
Although the webpage we created is functional and well organized, it's primary drawback is the simplicity of the filters.
### Recommendations:
In order to improve the functionality of the webpage, we recommend adding features onto the filters that can 
1) Allow users to select a date range and 
2) Allow users to see a dropdown list of unique values for each filter 

By adjusting the date filter to allow a date-range input as opposed to a specific-date, users can view the data with a broader view to see if there are any trends in UFO sightings over the course of a year (ex. summer vs winter). The addition of a drop-down list of unique values for each filter could improve the webpage if our data set grows too large. Smaller data sets can be glossed over with relative ease to determine key values to search for but with massive data sets, users could be limiting their analysis by simply not knowing all of the unique values they could be searching in the data set.
